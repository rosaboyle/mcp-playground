# Fixing macOS Code Signing ElectronTeamID Issues

## Problem

When packaging the application for macOS, you may encounter the following error:

```
Could not automatically determine ElectronTeamID from identity: 4938A52CA1569C384DF31B3544848EFBB62399CF
```

This error occurs during the code signing process when electron-builder cannot automatically extract the Apple Developer Team ID from the certificate being used for signing.

## Solution

To fix this issue, we need to explicitly provide the Apple Developer Team ID in one of the following ways:

### Option 1: Update electron-builder.yml

Add the `electronTeamId` property to the `mac` section of your electron-builder.yml file:

```yaml
mac:
  category: public.app-category.developer-tools
  darkModeSupport: true
  hardenedRuntime: true
  gatekeeperAssess: false
  entitlements: build/entitlements.mac.plist
  entitlementsInherit: build/entitlements.mac.plist
  target:
    - dmg
    - zip
  icon: assets/icons/icon.icns
  notarize: false
  electronTeamId: "YOUR_TEAM_ID" # Add your Apple Developer Team ID here
```

### Option 2: Set Environment Variable

Set the `ELECTRON_TEAM_ID` environment variable when running the build command:

```bash
ELECTRON_TEAM_ID=YOUR_TEAM_ID npm run package:mac
```

Or update your package.json scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "package:mac": "npm run build && CSC_FOR_PULL_REQUEST=true ELECTRON_TEAM_ID=YOUR_TEAM_ID npx electron-builder build --mac"
}
```

### Option 3: Set Team ID in GitHub Actions Workflow

For CI/CD builds in GitHub Actions, add the environment variable to your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Build Electron app for macOS
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    CSC_LINK: ${{ secrets.MACOS_CERTIFICATE }}
    CSC_KEY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PWD }}
    APPLE_ID: ${{ secrets.APPLE_ID }}
    APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.APPLE_ID_PASSWORD }}
    APPLE_TEAM_ID: ${{ secrets.APPLE_TEAM_ID }}
    ELECTRON_TEAM_ID: ${{ secrets.APPLE_TEAM_ID }}
```

## Finding Your Apple Developer Team ID

You can find your Apple Developer Team ID in several ways:

1. Log in to the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account) and look in the Membership section
2. View your certificates in Keychain Access and examine the certificate details
3. Run the following command to list your signing identities and extract the Team ID:
   ```bash
   security find-identity -v | grep "Developer ID Application"
   ```

## Additional Information

This issue typically occurs when:
- Your signing certificate doesn't have a clearly identifiable Team ID
- The application is being built on a CI/CD system with limited access to the certificate details
- The certificate name format is non-standard

By explicitly providing the Team ID, you ensure that electron-builder has the necessary information to properly code sign your application, regardless of whether it can extract this information from the certificate itself.
