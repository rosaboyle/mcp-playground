# Fireworks AI Integration with Airtrain

This document outlines the implementation of Fireworks AI in the trmx-agent Electron application using the airtrain npm package. 

## Implementation Details

### 1. AirtrainService Updates

The `AirtrainService` class in `src/main/services/airtrain-service.ts` has been updated to use the real Fireworks client from the airtrain npm package instead of the mock implementation:

```typescript
import { FireworksClient } from 'airtrain/dist/integrations/fireworks';
```

This allows the application to:
- Initialize the Fireworks client with an API key
- Make real API calls to the Fireworks API
- Stream chat completions from the Fireworks AI models
- Forward events from the stream to the renderer process

### 2. Path Updates

The import paths have been updated to correctly reference the airtrain package:

```typescript
const PROVIDER_MODULES: Record<string, string> = {
    fireworks: 'airtrain/dist/integrations/fireworks'
};
```

### 3. Content Security Policy

The Content Security Policy in `public/index.html` has been updated to allow 'unsafe-eval', which is required for the Fireworks client to operate properly:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval';">
```

### 4. Event Handling 

The streaming implementation has been fixed to properly handle events from the real Fireworks client, using the async iterator pattern:

```typescript
for await (const chunk of stream) {
    const content = chunk.choices?.[0]?.delta?.content || '';
    // Process content...
}
```

## Testing

A test script (`src/test_fireworks.ts`) has been created to verify that the integration works correctly. The script tests:

1. Initializing the Fireworks client
2. Basic chat completion
3. Streaming chat completion

To run the test script:

```bash
npx ts-node src/test_fireworks.ts
```

## Usage

To use the Fireworks integration in the application:

1. Set the Fireworks API key in the provider settings
2. Select the Fireworks provider as the active provider
3. Choose a Fireworks model (e.g., deepseek-r1)
4. Send a message in the chat interface

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the integration:

1. Verify that you have a valid Fireworks API key
2. Check that the provider is initialized successfully
3. Look for errors in the application logs
4. Try running the test script to verify the basic functionality
